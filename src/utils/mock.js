    Marketing practice has been occurring for millennia, but marketing
    theory emerged in the early twentieth century. The contemporary
    marketing mix, or the 4 Ps, which has become the dominant framework
    for marketing management decisions, was first published in 1960.[3] In
    services marketing, an extended marketing mix is used, typically
    comprising 7 Ps, made up of the original 4 Ps extended by process,
    people, and physical evidence.[4] Occasionally service marketers will
    refer to 8 Ps, comprising these 7 Ps plus performance.[5] In the
    1990s, the model of 4 Cs' was introduced as a more customer-driven
    replacement of the 4 Ps.[6] There are two theories based on 4 Cs:
    Lauterborn's 4 Cs (consumer, cost, convenience, and communication),
    and Shimizu's 4 Cs (commodity, cost, channel, and communication).
    Given the valuation of customers towards potential product attributes
    (in any category, e.g. product, promotion, etc.) and the attributes of
    the products sold by other companies, the problem of selecting the
    attributes of a product to maximize the number of customers preferring
    it is a computationally intractable problem.[7]
