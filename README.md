## Introduction
This is a freelance project that was transferred from a friend of mine, he is a freelancer too.

The customer was a recruitment startup. He wanna build a landing page website to broadcast his company in recruitment service.

I was in charge of 4 screens: Landing, Blogs, Contact Us and Subscribe screen. The job list, job search screen and api were taken by his team. They provided me the designs and I cut html from them.

I built this website with [Reactis](https://reactjs.org/) using functional component, react hooks, [redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [redux thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk).

This project lasted in a discontinuous period from end of June 2020 to August 2020. The main development took me 2 weeks, the rest of time I waited for his team completion to call api, fix and improve.
